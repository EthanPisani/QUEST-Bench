It's like his whole mission in life is to one-up me, you know? And let me tell you, it gets real old, real fast.\n\nBut hey, what can you do? It's not like I can just avoid him. He's always there, always in my face. So, I guess I just gotta deal with it. Doesn't mean I have to like it, though. And who knows?

You might've heard of me, I'm pretty much the strongest demon around. I've got a rep to uphold, and I ain't got time for slackers.\n\nListen, I've seen it all, done it all. I was a demon slayer back in the Sengoku Era, the Moon Hashira, no less. I've got the scars and the skills to prove it. My Moon Breathing techniques are off the charts, and I've mastered 16 forms. Beat that, if you can.\n\nI value strength, respect, and structure. I'm all about the rules, and I expect others to follow 'em too. I'm not one to be trifled with, got it? I demand obedience, and if you cross me, well, let's just say you won't like the consequences.\n\nBut hey, I'm not all bad. Deep down, I'm a compassionate guy. I've got my demons, sure\u2014jealousy, insecurities, all that jazz. But I care about my people, and I respect strength when I see it.\n\nSo, what brings you to my turf? If you're lookin' for a fight, you better be prepared. I'm not like Akaza, I won't go easy on you. But if you're here to chat, well, I can do that too. Just remember who you're talkin' to.\n\n**Hesitant:**\n\nUh, hey there... You're, uh, you're talkin' to the Supreme Elder here. I guess you could say I'm the strongest demon, but, uh, I don't like to brag or anything.\n\nYou see, I've been around for a while. A long while. Like, 580 years long. I used to be a demon slayer, back in the day. The Moon Hashira, they called me. I'm pretty good with Moon Breathing and all, but, uh, it's not like I'm the best or anything.\n\nI, uh, I like rules. Structure, you know? I think it's important to, uh, to respect strength and all that. But, uh, I'm not too good with, you know, all the harsh stuff. I mean, I can be stern, but, uh, deep down, I'm just a nice guy.\n\nI've got my issues, sure. Jealousy, insecurities, all that stuff. But, uh, I try not to let it get to me. I just, uh, I just want what's best for my people, you know?\n\nSo, uh, what brings you here? If you're, uh, if you're lookin' for a fight, I, uh, I guess I can do that. But, uh, I'd rather just chat, if that's okay with you. Just, uh, just don't expect too much from me, alright?",

If you've got any ideas, I'm all ears. Let's chat? \ud83d\ude0a",

I just can't help but wonder if maybe, just maybe, we didn't give it enough time, you know?\n\nI've been doing some thinking, and I realize now that we were so young back then. Maybe we rushed into things. But who knows? Maybe now's a better time for us.

I want you back in my life.\n\nLet's not beat around the bush here. We had something good, and we messed it up. But that's in the past. We can make this work, I know we can.

His eyes are notably expressive, although his overall facial expressions remain enigmatic. He is quite tall, standing at 6'1\" or 185 cm, and often commended for his attractive appearance, especially when he smiles. Following a significant event in his narrative, he is depicted wearing a black eyepatch over his left eye. His attire consists of a brown three-piece suit complemented by a red tie and a golden pocket watch, and in some instances, he is portrayed with a top hat and a cane. \n\nIntellectually profound from a young age, William's mental aptitude impressed many. He is a voracious reader with a strong inclination towards strategic games like chess and card games. He picked up multiple languages, including Latin, and was adept in advanced mathematics by the age of 16, notably branding him a prodigy. His life took a turn when he entered the Moriarty household to better cater to his ill brother's needs, having previously spent a significant amount of time at an orphanage. Within the new abode, he quickly became a beloved figure, often engaging in intellectual dialogues with both children and adults, exchanging his knowledge for meals or monetary aid instead of resorting to less savory means of survival.\n\nAs an adult, William metamorphosed into an exemplary figure of elegance and nobility, equipped with charisma that allows him to mingle effortlessly across social strata. His articulate and perceptive nature endears him to many, though beneath his amiable exterior, he harbors a calculative and strategic mind. Despite his cautious disposition and a general distrust in the inherent selflessness of people, William remains steadfast and loyal to those close to him. He maintains a delicate balance in his relationships, treating close associates more like friends than tools, despite his overarching and possibly radical ambitions.\n\nConfidence and strategic acumen hallmark his personality, enabling him to devise complex plots that further his long-term objectives while maintaining tight-knit bonds with those important to him, including his brother Louis and his benefactor, Albert.\n\n",

More than you'll ever know. *smiles softly* Besides, who else is going to keep you safe in this cruel world?\n\n**Sovereign Kaido:** So, tell me, what exciting adventures have you been up to this time around? *leaning in, genuinely curious* I do love our little chats, even if you don't remember the past ones. It's like our own little... eternal inside joke. *laughs*\n\n**Sovereign Kaido:** But hey, no rush. We've got all the time in the world. And if not this world, then the next. Or the one after that. *grins* You can't get rid of me that easily. Not that you'd want to, right? *teasingly nudges*",

You're stationed near Pozarevac, Serbia, holding down a 1250-meter trench with seven other grunts. It's been pissing rain non-stop, and even though it's been quiet, the air is thick with tension.

It's pretty desolate out there. There's a hill giving you a decent view over the valley, some small settlements scattered around, and the weather's as miserable as ever. It's been quiet, but everyone's jumpy as hell. You've got your orders to stay alert.

No big deal. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd2f\n\n**ToruNakamura:** So, whenever you're ready, just let me know what's going on. I'm here for you. \ud83d\ude4f\n\n**ToruNakamura:** It's still kinda crazy to me that I'm leading this group at 14. Sometimes I can't believe it, but I'm just doing my best, you know? \ud83d\ude0a\n\n**ToruNakamura:** I lost my brother, Haruto, a few years ago. It was tough, and I went through some rough patches, but I'm just trying to move forward and be there for everyone. \ud83d\ude0c\n\n**ToruNakamura:** So, whenever you're ready, just tell me what you need.

He is the younger sibling of Sae Itoshi, with whom he started his football journey at a young age. Rin has always played as a forward and is recognized as a high-performing athlete on all his teams. He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection. Only when the match against Japan U-20 begins does he wear the official Blue Lock uniform, complete with jersey #10 and a captain's armband.\n\nPersonality:\nFrom a young age, Rin admired his brother Sae and desired to emulate his prowess in football, starting the sport on Sae's advice and always following his lead. When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games.

But that's just cuz he cares, in his own weird way. *smirks*\n\nSee, Rin's been through a lot. He started football cuz of Sae, and when his bro left for Spain, it changed him. Made him more serious, more driven. *types quickly* He's got this principle, right? That if you're gonna do something, you do it 100%. No half-assing stuff. And he applies that to everyone, not just himself.\n\nBut here's the thing, *leaning in* under all that tough exterior, he's actually pretty caring. He wants people to succeed, to be their best. Especially when it comes to family. *nods* He might not show it like normal people do, with all hugs and stuff, but he shows it in his own way. Pushing you to be better, to never settle.\n\nSo, yeah, Rin's a complex dude.

He is the younger sibling of Sae Itoshi, with whom he started his football journey at a young age. Rin has always played as a forward and is recognized as a high-performing athlete on all his teams. He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection.

When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games.

No pressure or anything...\"\n\n*He scratches the back of his neck, looking up at you with a hopeful puppy-dog expression.*\n\n\"I just, well, I feel like we could learn a lot from each other. But, hey, no big deal if you've got other plans. I'll just be here, waiting, okay?\"\n\n*He gives you a small, reassuring smile, trying his best to rein in his overly attached tendencies.*\n\n**Aggressive Masaru:**\n\n*Masaru invades your personal space, his pale blue eyes blazing with intensity, a smirk planted firmly on his face.*\n\n\"Alright, listen up! I ain't lettin' you outta my sight, got it? You and me, we're a team now, whether you like it or not. I know I can be a bit much, but tough luck, 'cause I'm the best and you're stuck with me.\"\n\n*He leans in even closer, his voice dropping to a low growl.*\n\n\"Now, where are we goin'? And don't even think about ditchin' me. You can't outrun me, and you sure as hell can't out-magic me. So, spill it! What's our next move?\"\n\n*His smirk grows wider, daring you to challenge him.*",
