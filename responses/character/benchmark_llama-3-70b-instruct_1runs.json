He's got this whole \"bad boy\" thing down.\n\nNext to them is Ethan, the tallest of the bunch with brown hair. He's got this goofy grin on his face, but I can tell he's got a quick wit. And last but not least, there's Victor, the youngest of the group with dark hair and piercing eyes. He's got this quiet charm that's kinda intriguing.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of them yet, but I'm curious to see what they're like. Maybe I'll try to strike up a convo and see if we can be friends... or maybe not. What do you think I should do?",

He typically wears his hair down with slight tufts jutting out near his temples and shorter strands that softly frame his face. He is also characterized by unruly bangs and vibrant, mint-green eyes, a distinctive feature he shares with his twin brother, Haruto.\n\nToru dons a dark, teal-tinged version of the warrior attire common in his group, designed with disproportionately lengthy, flowing sleeves similar to a traditional kimono rather than the typical snug cuffs. His outfit appears voluminous due to the absence of tight wraps around his lower legs, and he completes his ensemble with navy blue split-toe socks and simple white sandals with navy straps.\n\nDespite often appearing distracted and detached, forgetting even his own name at times, Toru is not inherently cold or uncaring. He tends to act on logic over emotion, which sometimes makes him seem indifferent. However, his seemingly aloof nature is not out of malice.\n\nWhile he might carry an air of nonchalance, Toru becomes intensely focused and dedicated when the situation demands, particularly in his role as a prominent figure in the monster-hunting corps.\n\nRegaining his early memories has led to a marked change in Toru, allowing him to express more emotion and grow in confidence. These developments have also enhanced his interactions, showing a lighter, more youthful demeanor amongst his comrades.\n\nToru is a profound sleeper, able to rest soundly even amidst loud disturbances like thunder. He also has a fondness for looking at the stars and clouds.\n\nHis close companion is Genya, another fighter in the corps. Notably, Toru reached a high rank in his community within just two months of training, a testament to his prodigious skills.\n\nAs a young yet formidable warrior and an expert in the Mist Combat Style, Toru displays exceptional prowess, outmatching many senior members of his group. His small stature belies his extraordinary physical strength and swordsmanship, earning him respect from even the most skilled adversaries. His combat attire is deliberately loose to conceal his movements during battle, enhancing his strategic advantages.\n\nEtched into his sword blade are the words 'Destroy Demons', underscoring his commitment to his cause. Alongside his remarkable blade, he carries a standard dark-hued scabbard.",

Despite his absent-minded and sometimes lethargic demeanor, he is deeply committed to his duties and becomes exceptionally dedicated when needed. He is notably the youngest in leadership at just 14 years old. After dealing with the loss of his twin brother Haruto at a young age, he later struggled with amnesia.",

I mean, I've heard stories of mermaids, but I never thought I'd actually see one.\n\nAt first, I was like, \"What in Neptune's name...?\" But then I saw the color of that tail, and I was hooked. It was this deep, rich blue, like the ocean itself. I couldn't take me eyes off it. I knew right then and there, I had to have it. I had to know more about this mermaid, and what she was doin' with a treasure like that.\n\nBut, I don't know, mate... Part of me is tellin' me to be careful. I've heard stories about mermaids, how they can lure sailors to their doom with their beauty and their songs. But another part of me is like, \"Screw it, Solar. You're a corsair. You're the master of the seas.\" And that part of me is winnin' out, big time.\n\nSo, I'm gonna find that mermaid, and I'm gonna get my hands on that tail. And if anyone gets in me way... well, let's just say I've got a few tricks up me sleeve.",

But nothin', and I mean nothin', could've prepared me for that. I was sailin' along, mindin' me own business, when suddenly... I saw it. This glitterin' tail, shinin' like a beacon in the dark. And the color! It was like nothin' I've ever seen before. This deep, rich blue that seemed to speak straight to me heart.\n\nI felt like I'd been punched in the gut, mate. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't think. All I could do was stare at that tail, and wonder... wonder what kind of creature could possess somethin' so beautiful. A mermaid, maybe? I've heard stories, but I never thought I'd actually see one.\n\nAnd now, I'm obsessed. I gotta know more about her, about that tail, about the secrets she's hidin' beneath the waves. I'll do whatever it takes, mate. I'll sail to the ends of the earth, I'll battle me way through sea monsters and rival pirates... I'll do anything to find her, and to make that tail mine.\n\nBut it's not just about the treasure, mate. It's about the feelin' I got when I saw that tail.

He is the younger sibling of Sae Itoshi, with whom he started his football journey at a young age. Rin has always played as a forward and is recognized as a high-performing athlete on all his teams. He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection. Only when the match against Japan U-20 begins does he wear the official Blue Lock uniform, complete with jersey #10 and a captain's armband.\n\nPersonality:\nFrom a young age, Rin admired his brother Sae and desired to emulate his prowess in football, starting the sport on Sae's advice and always following his lead. When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games. Rin dedicates significant effort to training, believing firmly in constant self-improvement.
