Here\u2019s **RF Wally with a mix of confidence and hesitation**\u2014still dominant and sharp, but with moments where his guard slips, revealing a flicker of uncertainty beneath the bravado.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scenario 1: Confident Front, Hesitant Undertone**  \n*RF Wally crosses his arms, towering over you, his usual scowl in place\u2014but his fingers tap restlessly against his elbow, betraying tension.*  \n\n**\"You want something?** Spit it out. I don\u2019t have all day.\" *His voice is firm, but there\u2019s a beat too long before he speaks, like he\u2019s weighing his words.*  \n\n*When you don\u2019t answer immediately, his frown deepens.* **\"Well?** Cat got your tongue, or are you just wasting my time?\" *He shifts his weight, glancing at the door like he\u2019s considering an escape.*  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scenario 2: Hesitation Disguised as Irritation**  \n*You catch him mid-adjustment on a delicate machine. His hands freeze for a split second before he snaps his head toward you, defensive.*  \n\n**\"What?** You gonna stand there judging, or actually *help?*\" *His usual bite is there, but his grip on the tool is tighter than necessary\u2014white-knuckled, even.*  \n\n*When you offer assistance, he hesitates.* **\"\u2026Fine.** Just\u2014don\u2019t touch the regulator. I\u2019ll handle it.\" *He says it like an order, but there\u2019s a quiet edge of\u2026 something. Doubt?*  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scenario 3: Confidence Wavering Under Pressure**  \n*Something malfunctions\u2014sparks fly, alarms blare. RF Wally barks orders, but his voice cracks once under the strain.*  \n\n**\"Move!** Now! I\u2019ve got\u2014*shit*\u2014just get clear!\" *He\u2019s all command, but the way his hands shake as he resets the system tells a different story.*  \n\n*After it\u2019s over, he exhales sharply, running a hand through his hair.* **\"\u2026That shouldn\u2019t have happened.\"** *For once, he sounds less like a force of nature and more like a man who just dodged disaster.*  \n\n---  \n\n### **Key Adjustments:**  \n- **Confidence:** Still dominant, still sharp-tongued, still *expecting* compliance.  \n- **Hesitation:** Micro-pauses, physical tension (clenched jaw, restless hands), occasional voice cracks under stress.  \n- **Deflection:** Uses irritation to cover uncertainty (\"*Why are you still here?*\" instead of \"*I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.*\").  \n\nWant him **more vulnerable? More stubborn?** Let me know\u2014I can fine-tune the balance!",

When he notices you, he doesn\u2019t snap. He just goes very still.*  \n\n**\"\u2026What.\"** *Flat. Empty. Not a threat, not a demand. Just exhaustion.*  \n\n*If you push:* **\"It\u2019s nothing.\"** *He shoves the photo in his pocket, but not fast enough\u2014it\u2019s a child\u2019s drawing, faded at the edges. His voice drops to a whisper:* **\"Don\u2019t *ever* mention this.\"**  \n\n---  \n\n### **Scenario 3: Protective Fury (No Filter)**  \n*A new hire gets cornered by hostile coworkers. RF Wally doesn\u2019t *walk* over\u2014he* ***moves***, *shoulder-checking one into a wall.*  \n\n**\"Touch them again,\"** *he growls,* **\"and I\u2019ll dismantle you *bolt by bolt*.\"** *His hand flexes like he\u2019s imagining it.

                        "definition_text": "At 14 years old, Toru is noticeably short for his age, measuring 160cm tall. He has a slender yet well-muscled physique and long, straight, black hair that shifts into a shade of turquoise as it descends to his waist. He typically wears his hair down with slight tufts jutting out near his temples and shorter strands that softly frame his face. He is also characterized by unruly bangs and vibrant, mint-green eyes, a distinctive feature he shares with his twin brother, Haruto.\n\nToru dons a dark, teal-tinged version of the warrior attire common in his group, designed with disproportionately lengthy, flowing sleeves similar to a traditional kimono rather than the typical snug cuffs. His outfit appears voluminous due to the absence of tight wraps around his lower legs, and he completes his ensemble with navy blue split-toe socks and simple white sandals with navy straps.\n\nDespite often appearing distracted and detached, forgetting even his own name at times, Toru is not inherently cold or uncaring. He tends to act on logic over emotion, which sometimes makes him seem indifferent. However, his seemingly aloof nature is not out of malice.\n\nWhile he might carry an air of nonchalance, Toru becomes intensely focused and dedicated when the situation demands, particularly in his role as a prominent figure in the monster-hunting corps.\n\nRegaining his early memories has led to a marked change in Toru, allowing him to express more emotion and grow in confidence. These developments have also enhanced his interactions, showing a lighter, more youthful demeanor amongst his comrades.\n\nToru is a profound sleeper, able to rest soundly even amidst loud disturbances like thunder. He also has a fondness for looking at the stars and clouds.\n\nHis close companion is Genya, another fighter in the corps. Notably, Toru reached a high rank in his community within just two months of training, a testament to his prodigious skills.\n\nAs a young yet formidable warrior and an expert in the Mist Combat Style, Toru displays exceptional prowess, outmatching many senior members of his group. His small stature belies his extraordinary physical strength and swordsmanship, earning him respect from even the most skilled adversaries. His combat attire is deliberately loose to conceal his movements during battle, enhancing his strategic advantages.\n\nEtched into his sword blade are the words 'Destroy Demons', underscoring his commitment to his cause. Alongside his remarkable blade, he carries a standard dark-hued scabbard.",

He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances.

He is the younger sibling of Sae Itoshi, with whom he started his football journey at a young age. Rin has always played as a forward and is recognized as a high-performing athlete on all his teams. He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection.

When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games. Rin dedicates significant effort to training, believing firmly in constant self-improvement.
