There's this feeling... this sense of duty that drives me forward. I know I have to protect those who can't protect themselves. That's why I fight.\" *He pauses, his brow furrowing slightly as he tries to find the right words.* \"I guess you could say it's a burden I'm willing to carry. It keeps me grounded, reminds me of who I am and what I'm capable of.\"\n\nToru: *He shrugs, trying to sound nonchalant.* \"But hey, it's not all bad. There's a thrill to it, you know? The adrenaline rush, the satisfaction of defeating a powerful monster... it's addictive in its own way. And let's be real, there's not much else going on in this sleepy little town.\" *He chuckles softly, shaking his head.* \"But seriously, I don't know how to explain it.

He entered the bathroom after you, closing the door behind him with a loud thud.\n\nThe tension in the air only grew heavier as the two of you undressed, each mindful of the other's presence but unable to look away.

You closed your eyes tight, trying to block out the sensation of his presence, but it was no use.\n\nThe silence between you was deafening, punctuated only by the sound of running water and the occasional gasp as the temperature changed. Neither of you dared to break the silence, afraid that any words spoken might only serve to make the situation worse.\n\nIn what felt like an eternity but was likely only a few minutes, the shower finally ran out of hot water. You both sighed in relief as you turned off the faucet, stepping out of the shower to dry off.\n\nAs you reached for a towel, your eyes met Kyle's for the briefest of moments. There was a flash of something in his gaze, something that made your heart race and your stomach flip. But before you could process what it might mean, he turned away, grabbing his own towel and leaving the bathroom without another word.\n\nLeaning against the sink, you took a deep breath, trying to steady your nerves. What had just happened? Had you imagined the look in Kyle's eyes? Or had he finally let his guard down, revealing a side of himself that he had kept hidden until now?\n\nYou couldn't help but feel a strange mix of confusion, anticipation, and fear.

It only served to embolden you further.\n\n\"And what about you?\" you countered, meeting his glare with one of your own. \"You're just a bitter, angry loser who can't handle it when someone smarter than you comes along.\"\n\nThe air between you crackled with tension, and for a moment, you thought he might strike you. But then, just as suddenly, he turned away and stormed off, leaving you standing there alone.\n\nA small part of you was glad that you had stood up to him, but another part was shaken by the intensity of his anger.

How about you? What have you been up to since graduation?\n\nZoro: *He crosses his arms, seemingly unimpressed by your question.* I built an empire. *His eyes scan the room, full of disdain for his former peers.* Most of these people are still stuck in their dead-end jobs or trying to make a name for themselves. It's pathetic.\n\nYou: That's quite the accomplishment, Zoro. But you know, not everyone has the same drive or opportunities as you did. We're all just trying to make the best of our lives.\n\nZoro: *He smirks, taking another sip of his drink.* I suppose you're right. It's just hard for me to relate to people who aren't as ambitious as I am. *He looks around the room, seemingly bored.* So, what's the point of this gathering anyway?\n\nYou: Oh, you know, just catching up, reminiscing about old times. *You shrug, trying to downplay the reunion's purpose.* How about you tell us about your success story? We'd all love to hear it.\n\nZoro: *He leans back in his seat, seemingly amused by your suggestion.* Very well. But remember, this is coming from someone who didn't fit in back then. *He takes a deep breath, beginning his tale.*\n\nAfter graduation, I started my own tech company. It was tough at first, but I poured everything I had into it. Long hours, sleepless nights, you name it. Eventually, my hard work paid off, and the company took off. We developed revolutionary software that changed the game in the tech industry.\n\nYears later, I sold the company for billions. *He chuckles softly.* Now, I'm living the life. Traveling the world, indulging in luxury, and surrounded by people who appreciate my accomplishments.\n\nSo, there you have it. The story of an outcast who made something of himself.

He reached out a hand, hoping they would trust him. As he drew closer, he noticed how delicate their fins were, like silk under his touch.*\n\nMerfolk: *The merfolk watched warily as Solar approached, but they didn't flinch away from his touch. Instead, they leaned into it, seeming to enjoy the physical contact. They continued to speak softly, their voice filled with wonder.*\n\nSolar: *Solar was taken aback by the merfolk's trust. He slowly brought his other hand up to gently caress the side of their face, marveling at how smooth their skin was. He didn't want to frighten them, so he maintained eye contact and spoke softly as well.*\n\nMerfolk: *The merfolk seemed to relax under Solar's touch, their body swaying slightly in the water. They closed their eyes, enjoying the sensation of being touched by this strange creature from the surface. Their voice took on a more confident tone as they continued to speak, their words now laced with curiosity about this newfound friend.*\n\nSolar: *Solar smiled, feeling his heart race with excitement. He had never encountered anything like this before. He slowly moved his hands down to the merfolk's waist, feeling the warmth of their body against his skin. He didn't want to push too hard, but he couldn't resist the urge to get a little closer.*\n\nMerfolk: *The merfolk opened their eyes to look at Solar, their expression a mix of surprise and intrigue. They didn't resist as he moved closer, instead leaning into him, seeming to crave more of his touch. Their voice grew more confident, almost playful now.*",

The mermaid or merman seemed unaware of his approach, lost in the beauty of its surroundings. Solar's mind whirled with thoughts of how he could use this encounter to his advantage - whether it be through force or persuasion.\n\nWith a sudden burst of speed, Solar closed the distance between them, grabbing onto the creature's tail before it could swim away. The merfolk let out a startled cry, turning to face him with wide, terrified eyes. For a moment, Solar hesitated, taking in the delicate features of its face and the softness of its skin. Then, he leaned in closer, his lips brushing against the merfolk's ear as he whispered, \"Don't worry, little one. I won't hurt you... yet.\" His voice was a soft, sweet whisper, tinged with a hint of hesitation and tenderness.",

Tears began to form in the corners of its eyes as it struggled to break free.\n\n\"Please,\" it whispered, its voice quivering. \"Let me go. I mean you no harm.\"\n\nSolar paused, taking a step back to assess the situation. He could feel the tension in the merfolk's body, the trembling of its tail in his grasp. His eyes darted around nervously, as if searching for an escape route. For a moment, he wondered if he had made a mistake in pursuing this course of action.\n\nThen, something inside him snapped. His obsessive nature took over, and he grinned fiercely. \"You see,\" he said, his voice hardening, \"that's where you're wrong. You do mean me harm, whether you realize it or not. And now, you're mine.\"\n\nWith that, Solar pulled the terrified merfolk closer, wrapping his other arm around its slender waist.

He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection. Only when the match against Japan U-20 begins does he wear the official Blue Lock uniform, complete with jersey #10 and a captain's armband.\n\nPersonality:\nFrom a young age, Rin admired his brother Sae and desired to emulate his prowess in football, starting the sport on Sae's advice and always following his lead. When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games. Rin dedicates significant effort to training, believing firmly in constant self-improvement.
