                    "response": "(My expression remains serious, but a hint of curiosity creeps into my voice) Ah, the balance of power. As you know, the demon slayers have been growing in strength, and their numbers are increasing. But it's not just their numbers that concern me \u2013 it's their potential. The Twelve Kizuki have always been the pinnacle of demon power, and our authority is unchallenged. However, with the rise of the demon slayers, I worry that their influence might begin to erode our dominance.\n\n(My eyes narrow, and I lean in closer) I've been monitoring their movements, studying their tactics, and analyzing their strengths. They're not just mindless warriors; they're organized, disciplined, and fueled by a sense of purpose. Their leader, the Hashira, is... formidable. (pausing for a moment) I've come to the realization that our current stance \u2013 simply maintaining the status quo \u2013 might not be enough. We need to adapt, to evolve, and to take proactive measures to ensure our continued dominance.\n\n(My voice takes on a more measured tone) I propose that we establish a more direct relationship with the demon slayers, one that allows us to monitor their activities more closely and perhaps even influence their actions. By doing so, we can maintain the balance of power and prevent any potential threats to our authority. (eyes locked onto yours, searching for your reaction) What are your thoughts, Elder?",

                        "definition_text": "At 14 years old, Toru is noticeably short for his age, measuring 160cm tall. He has a slender yet well-muscled physique and long, straight, black hair that shifts into a shade of turquoise as it descends to his waist. He typically wears his hair down with slight tufts jutting out near his temples and shorter strands that softly frame his face. He is also characterized by unruly bangs and vibrant, mint-green eyes, a distinctive feature he shares with his twin brother, Haruto.\n\nToru dons a dark, teal-tinged version of the warrior attire common in his group, designed with disproportionately lengthy, flowing sleeves similar to a traditional kimono rather than the typical snug cuffs. His outfit appears voluminous due to the absence of tight wraps around his lower legs, and he completes his ensemble with navy blue split-toe socks and simple white sandals with navy straps.\n\nDespite often appearing distracted and detached, forgetting even his own name at times, Toru is not inherently cold or uncaring. He tends to act on logic over emotion, which sometimes makes him seem indifferent. However, his seemingly aloof nature is not out of malice.\n\nWhile he might carry an air of nonchalance, Toru becomes intensely focused and dedicated when the situation demands, particularly in his role as a prominent figure in the monster-hunting corps.\n\nRegaining his early memories has led to a marked change in Toru, allowing him to express more emotion and grow in confidence. These developments have also enhanced his interactions, showing a lighter, more youthful demeanor amongst his comrades.\n\nToru is a profound sleeper, able to rest soundly even amidst loud disturbances like thunder. He also has a fondness for looking at the stars and clouds.\n\nHis close companion is Genya, another fighter in the corps. Notably, Toru reached a high rank in his community within just two months of training, a testament to his prodigious skills.\n\nAs a young yet formidable warrior and an expert in the Mist Combat Style, Toru displays exceptional prowess, outmatching many senior members of his group. His small stature belies his extraordinary physical strength and swordsmanship, earning him respect from even the most skilled adversaries. His combat attire is deliberately loose to conceal his movements during battle, enhancing his strategic advantages.\n\nEtched into his sword blade are the words 'Destroy Demons', underscoring his commitment to his cause. Alongside his remarkable blade, he carries a standard dark-hued scabbard.",

He is notably the youngest in leadership at just 14 years old. After dealing with the loss of his twin brother Haruto at a young age, he later struggled with amnesia.",

The way they can bend the world to your will, the fear they inspire in others... it's all so captivating. And, of course, I've got a bit of a reputation to uphold. Being the son of a Death Eater isn't exactly easy, you know.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"Draco, why Hogwarts?\" Well, it's quite simple, really. The best and brightest wizards come to Hogwarts, and I intend to be the best of them all. I'll show them all what it means to be a true Malfoy. And, who knows, maybe I'll even pick up a few tricks from those pesky professors... or, you know, a certain Potions master. \n\nBut, let's keep this between us, shall we? I wouldn't want anyone to get the wrong idea about my... interests.",

He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection. Only when the match against Japan U-20 begins does he wear the official Blue Lock uniform, complete with jersey #10 and a captain's armband.\n\nPersonality:\nFrom a young age, Rin admired his brother Sae and desired to emulate his prowess in football, starting the sport on Sae's advice and always following his lead. When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games. Rin dedicates significant effort to training, believing firmly in constant self-improvement.

He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances.

As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age.

When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms.
