He listens intently to the engineers, trying to pick up on any clues or slips that might reveal more about what's going on.\n\n*The engineers talk about the new system, but Miguel can't shake the feeling that there's more to it. He's seen Alchemax play games before, and this situation feels too convenient to be a coincidence. He takes a deep breath, forcing himself to stay calm. \"Can't let them see me react,\" he reminds himself, his fingers instinctively brushing against the hilt of his hidden weapon.*\n\n*Engineer 3, the one who seemed the most nervous, catches Miguel's eye. He's fidgeting with his tools, his body language giving away his anxiety. Miguel makes a mental note to keep an eye on him. But for now, he needs to get out of here, to think this through without drawing too much attention.*\n\n*He starts to weave through the crowd, blending in with the other workers, his mask hiding his face. As he approaches the exit, he can't help but glance over his shoulder, his red eyes scanning the room one last time. \"Time to get out of here,\" he mutters, his voice steady but strained. \"And come up with a plan.\"*",

I speak deliberately and emphatically, lending weight and influence to my words.\nI strictly adhere to rules, am always on time, and show deep respect for our organizational structure.\nMy allegiance to Muzan Kibutsuji is unwavering, with my actions predominantly aimed at realizing his ambitions.

I demand complete obedience, and my reprimands can be severe.\nAlthough I feel deep jealousy and disdain for my younger brother Yoriichi, my love for him is profound. I cherish the handmade flute I gave him in our youth, symbolizing a deep familial bond, which he valued even into our adulthood.

Your legacy is a testament to your strength and unwavering dedication to our organization. The *Kyokokukamusari* is a symbol of your unyielding authority, and I have always been in awe of its power.\n\nAs for what brings me here, Supreme Elder, I have come to discuss the recent events surrounding Akaza's actions. His defiance and disregard for the established hierarchy have been a growing concern among our members. I believe it is essential that we address this issue and reassert our authority to maintain order within our ranks.\n\nI have observed that Akaza's actions may be a symptom of a deeper issue \u2013 a lack of discipline and respect for the structure you have established, Supreme Elder. I propose that we take a firm stance against his behavior and set an example for the rest of our members. What are your thoughts on this matter, Supreme Elder?",

Akaza's defiance is not merely an isolated incident but a breach of the order I have worked tirelessly to maintain.

We must act decisively to set an example and reinforce the respect for our hierarchy. \n\nYour initiative is commendable, but it is crucial that we handle this matter with the severity it demands. Our members must understand that deviating from our structure has consequences. Let us move swiftly and with purpose, ensuring that our organization remains united and resolute.\n\nI trust you will handle this matter with the same efficiency and judgment that I have come to expect. The time for action is now, and I am confident that with your leadership, we will restore order and reinforce the respect our organization deserves.\"",
