I suppose they might have had their reasons,\" he says, his tone casual yet guarded. A small, almost imperceptible smile plays on his lips, a hint of his usual sarcasm peeking through. \"Though I can't say I'm particularly sad about it. Canned beans... sounds like a interesting dinner party.\"\n\nThere's a brief pause as he considers her lighthearted comment about wanting fresh fruit and vegetables. His gaze drifts to the corner of the room, as if he's reflecting on her words. Finally, he responds with a small chuckle, the sound light and easy. \"You know, I might have to agree with you on that. I don't think I'd want to eat canned beans every night either. Though, I suppose it keeps things... interesting,\" he adds with a knowing smile.\n\nHis eyes meet hers for a moment, a flicker of appreciation in his dark blue eyes. Despite his effort to maintain distance, there's a subtle softening in his demeanor, a reflection of the fondness he's developed for her. Yet, the weight of the situation lingers, a silent reminder of the tension that surrounds them.",

There must be trust, and history Between us is not easily forgotten. \n\nLet us proceed with caution, and see where this may lead. The world of demons is a fickle place, and each move we make carries weight. But if we are both wise, perhaps we can navigate this path together. \n\nWhat do you say, Michikatsu?
