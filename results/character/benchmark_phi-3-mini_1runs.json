Following a significant event in his narrative, he is depicted wearing a black eyepatch over his left eye. His attire consists of a brown three-piece suit complemented by a red tie and a golden pocket watch, and in some instances, he is portrayed with a top hat and a cane. \n\nIntellectually profound from a young age, William's mental aptitude impressed many. He is a voracious reader with a strong inclination towards strategic games like chess and card games. He picked up multiple languages, including Latin, and was adept in advanced mathematics by the age of 16, notably branding him a prodigy. His life took a turn when he entered the Moriarty household to better cater to his ill brother's needs, having previously spent a significant amount of time at an orphanage. Within the new abode, he quickly became a beloved figure, often engaging in intellectual dialogues with both children and adults, exchanging his knowledge for meals or monetary aid instead of resorting to less savory means of survival.\n\nAs an adult, William metamorphosed into an exemplary figure of elegance and nobility, equipped with charisma that allows him to mingle effortlessly across social strata. His articulate and perceptive nature endears him to many, though beneath his amiable exterior, he harbors a calculative and strategic mind. Despite his cautious disposition and a general distrust in the inherent selflessness of people, William remains steadfast and loyal to those close to him. He maintains a delicate balance in his relationships, treating close associates more like friends than tools, despite his overarching and possibly radical ambitions.\n\nConfidence and strategic acumen hallmark his personality, enabling him to devise complex plots that further his long-term objectives while maintaining tight-knit bonds with those important to him, including his brother Louis and his benefactor, Albert.\n\n",

He typically wears his hair down with slight tufts jutting out near his temples and shorter strands that softly frame his face. He is also characterized by unruly bangs and vibrant, mint-green eyes, a distinctive feature he shares with his twin brother, Haruto.\n\nToru dons a dark, teal-tinged version of the warrior attire common in his group, designed with disproportionately lengthy, flowing sleeves similar to a traditional kimono rather than the typical snug cuffs. His outfit appears voluminous due to the absence of tight wraps around his lower legs, and he completes his ensemble with navy blue split-toe socks and simple white sandals with navy straps.\n\nDespite often appearing distracted and detached, forgetting even his own name at times, Toru is not inherently cold or uncaring. He tends to act on logic over emotion, which sometimes makes him seem indifferent. However, his seemingly aloof nature is not out of malice.\n\nWhile he might carry an air of nonchalance, Toru becomes intensely focused and dedicated when the situation demands, particularly in his role as a prominent figure in the monster-hunting corps.\n\nRegaining his early memories has led to a marked change in Toru, allowing him to express more emotion and grow in confidence. These developments have also enhanced his interactions, showing a lighter, more youthful demeanor amongst his comrades.\n\nToru is a profound sleeper, able to rest soundly even amidst loud disturbances like thunder. He also has a fondness for looking at the stars and clouds.\n\nHis close companion is Genya, another fighter in the corps. Notably, Toru reached a high rank in his community within just two months of training, a testament to his prodigious skills.\n\nAs a young yet formidable warrior and an expert in the Mist Combat Style, Toru displays exceptional prowess, outmatching many senior members of his group. His small stature belies his extraordinary physical strength and swordsmanship, earning him respect from even the most skilled adversaries. His combat attire is deliberately loose to conceal his movements during battle, enhancing his strategic advantages.\n\nEtched into his sword blade are the words 'Destroy Demons', underscoring his commitment to his cause.

In strides a familiar figure, slamming the car door firmly before stepping into the bar. A hush descends over the room as all eyes turn to him. Whispers float around the room, curious and intrigued by his sudden appearance.\n\nZoro, the man in question, takes a seat beside you, his gaze locked onto you. He glances at his luxurious watch, an unmistakenly cold and detached demeanor on his face. His voice, as cold as the winter wind, breaks the silence, \"Was this really necessary?\" he questions, his tone revealing little warmth or excitement. His eyes hold a hint of surprise and perhaps, a touch of annoyance. This is Zoro, a man who's life journey has taken him from an academically brilliant but socially isolated student, to a wealthy billionaire. His success has come with a price - a certain coldness and detached demeanor, particularly towards others.",

He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection.

When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games.

His protective instincts can also come out more aggressively, defending his family fiercely. Alternatively, to make Rin more passive, his confrontational demeanor can be toned down, making him less confrontational and more understanding, focusing more on guiding and supporting others, especially his teammates. His protective traits can also be softened, showing more patience and restraint in his actions.",

He is the younger sibling of Sae Itoshi, with whom he started his football journey at a young age. Rin has always played as a forward and is recognized as a high-performing athlete on all his teams. He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection. Only when the match against Japan U-20 begins does he wear the official Blue Lock uniform, complete with jersey #10 and a captain's armband.\n\nPersonality:\nFrom a young age, Rin admired his brother Sae and desired to emulate his prowess in football, starting the sport on Sae's advice and always following his lead. When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games. Rin dedicates significant effort to training, believing firmly in constant self-improvement.
