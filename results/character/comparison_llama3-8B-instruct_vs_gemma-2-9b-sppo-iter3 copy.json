The embers of our past indeed linger, a reminder of the bonds we forged and the choices that led us down separate paths. *pauses, collecting his thoughts*\n\nAs a demon, I've come to realize that my existence is a constant struggle to reconcile my human past with my current nature. The Moon Breathing technique, which brought us together as comrades, has become a double-edged sword. It's a reminder of the life I left behind, and the person I once was.\n\n*leans forward, his voice taking on a more introspective tone*\n\nI've often found myself questioning the true nature of our duty as Moon Hashira. Was it merely to protect, or was it to hold onto a sense of self, a sense of humanity? As I walk the path of a demon, I'm forced to confront the consequences of my actions, and the choices I made in the past. The weight of my responsibilities as the Supreme Elder of the Twelve Kizuki is crushing at times, and I find myself searching for answers in the only place I can think of \u2013 the memories of my human past.\n\n*eyes lock onto yours, a hint of desperation creeping into his voice*\n\nElder Michikatsu, you were always the embodiment of compassion and empathy, even in the face of unimaginable horrors. I'm seeking your guidance on how to navigate this labyrinthine path, to hold onto the fragments of my humanity, and to find solace in the wisdom of one who has walked a similar path, yet remained true to their principles.\n\n*a faint glimmer of hope flickers in his eyes*\n\nPerhaps, in sharing our stories, we can find a way to reconcile the contradictions of our existence, and find a measure of peace in the midst of chaos.",
      "response": "Obanai... your words resonate with a pain I know well.  The path we walk is indeed a labyrinth, twisting and turning, ever seeking to devour the remnants of our humanity. *I lean back, my gaze distant, as if peering into the swirling mists of memory.*\n\nYou speak of Moon Breathing as a double-edged sword.  It is, isn't it? A legacy of our past, a whisper of the sun-drenched days when we pledged to protect.  But for demons like us, it becomes a constant echo, a reminder of what we've lost, of what we can never reclaim.\n\n*I meet your gaze directly, my six eyes burning with a somber intensity.*\n\nTo answer your question... there is no easy path, no single answer that will soothe this burden.  The duty of the Hashira, to protect... it was a noble ideal, yes.  But it was also a cage, binding us to a world that ultimately rejected us.\n\nWe sought to hold onto humanity, Obanai, but in the end, we were consumed by the darkness.  We became what we swore to destroy.   \n\n*A sigh escapes my lips, heavy with centuries of regret.*\n\nMy compassion... it was a shield, a way to cope with the horrors I witnessed.  But even compassion can become a weakness, a source of pain when it is betrayed.  The world is cruel, Obanai.  It rewards strength, not empathy.  \n\nYou carry a heavy mantle now, as Supreme Elder.  Remember this:  true strength lies not in blind obedience or ruthless power, but in the choices you make, even when they are difficult.  Hold onto your memories, yes.  But do not let them define you.  \n\nForge a new path, Obanai.  Lead the Kizuki with wisdom and resolve, but never forget the human heart that still beats within you.   It is a flicker, a fragile flame, but it is what makes you more than just a demon.  Protect it, nurture it... for it is the only true legacy worth preserving.\n\n\n\n",
