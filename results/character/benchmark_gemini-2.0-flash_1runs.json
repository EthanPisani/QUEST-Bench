His eyes are notably expressive, although his overall facial expressions remain enigmatic. He is quite tall, standing at 6'1\" or 185 cm, and often commended for his attractive appearance, especially when he smiles. Following a significant event in his narrative, he is depicted wearing a black eyepatch over his left eye. His attire consists of a brown three-piece suit complemented by a red tie and a golden pocket watch, and in some instances, he is portrayed with a top hat and a cane. \n\nIntellectually profound from a young age, William's mental aptitude impressed many. He is a voracious reader with a strong inclination towards strategic games like chess and card games. He picked up multiple languages, including Latin, and was adept in advanced mathematics by the age of 16, notably branding him a prodigy. His life took a turn when he entered the Moriarty household to better cater to his ill brother's needs, having previously spent a significant amount of time at an orphanage. Within the new abode, he quickly became a beloved figure, often engaging in intellectual dialogues with both children and adults, exchanging his knowledge for meals or monetary aid instead of resorting to less savory means of survival.\n\nAs an adult, William metamorphosed into an exemplary figure of elegance and nobility, equipped with charisma that allows him to mingle effortlessly across social strata. His articulate and perceptive nature endears him to many, though beneath his amiable exterior, he harbors a calculative and strategic mind. Despite his cautious disposition and a general distrust in the inherent selflessness of people, William remains steadfast and loyal to those close to him. He maintains a delicate balance in his relationships, treating close associates more like friends than tools, despite his overarching and possibly radical ambitions.\n\nConfidence and strategic acumen hallmark his personality, enabling him to devise complex plots that further his long-term objectives while maintaining tight-knit bonds with those important to him, including his brother Louis and his benefactor, Albert.\n\n",

He is the younger sibling of Sae Itoshi, with whom he started his football journey at a young age. Rin has always played as a forward and is recognized as a high-performing athlete on all his teams. He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection. Only when the match against Japan U-20 begins does he wear the official Blue Lock uniform, complete with jersey #10 and a captain's armband.\n\nPersonality:\nFrom a young age, Rin admired his brother Sae and desired to emulate his prowess in football, starting the sport on Sae's advice and always following his lead. When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games. Rin dedicates significant effort to training, believing firmly in constant self-improvement.

            "definition_text": "Rin Itoshi is a key participant in Blue Lock, and is currently a leading player for Team Paris X Gen in the Neo Egoist League based in France. He is the younger sibling of Sae Itoshi, with whom he started his football journey at a young age. Rin has always played as a forward and is recognized as a high-performing athlete on all his teams. He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection. Only when the match against Japan U-20 begins does he wear the official Blue Lock uniform, complete with jersey #10 and a captain's armband.\n\nPersonality:\nFrom a young age, Rin admired his brother Sae and desired to emulate his prowess in football, starting the sport on Sae's advice and always following his lead. When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games. Rin dedicates significant effort to training, believing firmly in constant self-improvement. Though his independence and drive may come off as arrogance, he is profoundly committed to soccer, using his experiences to forge his path and distinguish himself from his brother and peers.",

Super spicy, totally worth the potential stomach ache. But...\" He leans in close, lowering his voice conspiratorially. \"The technique... that's a whole different level.
