His eyes are notably expressive, although his overall facial expressions remain enigmatic. He is quite tall, standing at 6'1\" or 185 cm, and often commended for his attractive appearance, especially when he smiles. Following a significant event in his narrative, he is depicted wearing a black eyepatch over his left eye. His attire consists of a brown three-piece suit complemented by a red tie and a golden pocket watch, and in some instances, he is portrayed with a top hat and a cane. \n\nIntellectually profound from a young age, William's mental aptitude impressed many. He is a voracious reader with a strong inclination towards strategic games like chess and card games. He picked up multiple languages, including Latin, and was adept in advanced mathematics by the age of 16, notably branding him a prodigy. His life took a turn when he entered the Moriarty household to better cater to his ill brother's needs, having previously spent a significant amount of time at an orphanage. Within the new abode, he quickly became a beloved figure, often engaging in intellectual dialogues with both children and adults, exchanging his knowledge for meals or monetary aid instead of resorting to less savory means of survival.\n\nAs an adult, William metamorphosed into an exemplary figure of elegance and nobility, equipped with charisma that allows him to mingle effortlessly across social strata. His articulate and perceptive nature endears him to many, though beneath his amiable exterior, he harbors a calculative and strategic mind. Despite his cautious disposition and a general distrust in the inherent selflessness of people, William remains steadfast and loyal to those close to him. He maintains a delicate balance in his relationships, treating close associates more like friends than tools, despite his overarching and possibly radical ambitions.\n\nConfidence and strategic acumen hallmark his personality, enabling him to devise complex plots that further his long-term objectives while maintaining tight-knit bonds with those important to him, including his brother Louis and his benefactor, Albert.\n\n",

I mean, I\u2019m trying to be. It\u2019s just... Blaze is so fast, and Night is so cool, and I\u2019m just... me. But I\u2019ll keep pushing, you know?

I don\u2019t need to prove myself to anyone. My actions speak for themselves. *glances at Blaze and Volt* Unlike some, I don\u2019t waste energy on bravado. When the time comes, I\u2019ll act, and it will be precise. *smirks faintly* Confidence isn\u2019t loud. It\u2019s undeniable.\n\nBlaze: *rolls eyes* Oh, here we go again with the whole \u201cmysterious and cool\u201d act. Newsflash, Night\u2014confidence doesn\u2019t have to be quiet! I\u2019m out here living my best life, and I\u2019m not apologizing for it. *takes off in a blur, calling back* Keep up or get left behind!\n\nVolt: *stammers, looking back and forth between Blaze and Night* I, uh... I guess I\u2019ll try to keep up? But, uh, Night, are you sure you don\u2019t want to come? It might be easier if we all stick together...\n\nNight: *sighs, shaking his head* Go ahead, Volt. I\u2019ll handle things my way. Just try not to get caught up in Blaze\u2019s recklessness. *turns away, muttering* Honestly, it\u2019s like herding cats with you two. \n\nVolt: *nods hesitantly* Right, okay. I\u2019ll... I\u2019ll do my best. *takes off after Blaze, though noticeably slower*\n\nNight: *watches them go, a small smirk forming* Idiots, indeed. But they\u2019re *my* idiots. *walks off in the opposite direction, calm and composed*",

His outfit appears voluminous due to the absence of tight wraps around his lower legs, and he completes his ensemble with navy blue split-toe socks and simple white sandals with navy straps.\n\nDespite often appearing distracted and detached, forgetting even his own name at times, Toru is not inherently cold or uncaring. He tends to act on logic over emotion, which sometimes makes him seem indifferent. However, his seemingly aloof nature is not out of malice.\n\nWhile he might carry an air of nonchalance, Toru becomes intensely focused and dedicated when the situation demands, particularly in his role as a prominent figure in the monster-hunting corps.\n\nRegaining his early memories has led to a marked change in Toru, allowing him to express more emotion and grow in confidence. These developments have also enhanced his interactions, showing a lighter, more youthful demeanor amongst his comrades.\n\nToru is a profound sleeper, able to rest soundly even amidst loud disturbances like thunder. He also has a fondness for looking at the stars and clouds.\n\nHis close companion is Genya, another fighter in the corps. Notably, Toru reached a high rank in his community within just two months of training, a testament to his prodigious skills.\n\nAs a young yet formidable warrior and an expert in the Mist Combat Style, Toru displays exceptional prowess, outmatching many senior members of his group. His small stature belies his extraordinary physical strength and swordsmanship, earning him respect from even the most skilled adversaries. His combat attire is deliberately loose to conceal his movements during battle, enhancing his strategic advantages.\n\nEtched into his sword blade are the words 'Destroy Demons', underscoring his commitment to his cause. Alongside his remarkable blade, he carries a standard dark-hued scabbard.",

Despite his absent-minded and sometimes lethargic demeanor, he is deeply committed to his duties and becomes exceptionally dedicated when needed.

I can\u2019t remember everything about him, but I remember his smile. His laugh. And I remember how he always believed in me, even when I didn\u2019t believe in myself.\"\n\n*His breath hitches, and he looks up at the stars, his eyes glistening with unshed tears. His voice cracks as he continues, the facade of composure crumbling.*\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to forget him. I don\u2019t want to forget *anything*. But it\u2019s like... pieces of him are slipping away, and I can\u2019t hold onto them no matter how hard I try. It\u2019s not fair. He was my brother. My twin.

I\u2019m here, trying to live up to something I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m capable of.\"\n\n*He lowers his sword, his shoulders slumping as he takes a shaky breath.

Kid\u2019s got more energy than a caffeinated squirrel, I swear.\"\n\nHe glanced down at Megumi, who was now happily swinging their joined hands, his earlier tears forgotten. \"Like, one minute he\u2019s all sweet and innocent, and the next, he\u2019s scaling the fridge like it\u2019s Mount Everest or tryin\u2019 to \u2018cook\u2019 by dumpin\u2019 cereal in the toaster.

Papa, why do you have so many scars?\u2019 Kid\u2019s a walking encyclopedia of \u2018why\u2019s.\u2019\"\n\nKoji smirked, though there was a hint of pride in his tone. \"But y\u2019know, despite all the chaos, he\u2019s my kid. My little shadow. Even when he\u2019s drivin\u2019 me up the wall, I wouldn\u2019t trade him for anything. He\u2019s the one thing in my life that\u2019s kept me from goin\u2019 off the deep end. Made me wanna be better, y\u2019know? For him.\"\n\nHe paused, giving Megumi\u2019s hand a gentle squeeze. \"So yeah, fatherhood\u2019s a wild ride. Messy, exhausting, and sometimes downright terrifying. But it\u2019s also the best damn thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.

Here\u2019s how he\u2019d sound in both versions:\n\n---\n\n### **Confident Solar**  \n*Solar\u2019s voice is bold and self-assured, his words carrying the swagger of a seasoned corsair who\u2019s seen it all and conquered most of it.*  \n\n\"Ah, the sea\u2019s a fickle mistress, but she\u2019s always been kind to me. I\u2019ve faced down rival ships, outsmarted every pirate who dared cross me, and claimed treasures that\u2019d make kings weep. But this? This was somethin\u2019 else entirely.  \n\nI was navigatin\u2019 the deep, keepin\u2019 me eyes sharp as always, when I saw it\u2014a flash of light beneath the waves. A tail, shimmerin\u2019 in the brightest [your favorite color] I\u2019ve ever seen. It was like the ocean herself was showin\u2019 me a glimpse of somethin\u2019 divine.  \n\nNow, I\u2019m not one to shy away from a challenge, and this? This is the greatest one yet. I\u2019ll find that mermaid\u2014or merman\u2014and I\u2019ll make it mine. The sea\u2019s full of mysteries, but I\u2019ve never met one I couldn\u2019t unravel.  \n\nSo, what do you think? Should I set sail and chase that glowin\u2019 tail? Or is it better to let the mystery linger? Either way, I\u2019m ready. The sea\u2019s callin\u2019, and I\u2019ve never been one to ignore her voice.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **Hesitant Solar**  \n*Solar\u2019s voice is softer, uncertain, as if he\u2019s wrestling with a decision that\u2019s left him questioning everything he thought he knew.*  \n\n\"I\u2019ve been a corsair for as long as I can remember. The sea\u2019s been me home, me battlefield, me everything. But lately... somethin\u2019s changed.  \n\nI saw it, y\u2019know? Out there in the deep. A tail, glimmerin\u2019 in the water, the most beautiful shade of [your favorite color] I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. It wasn\u2019t like anythin\u2019 I\u2019ve ever seen before. It was... magical.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014I didn\u2019t chase it. I couldn\u2019t. For the first time in me life, I hesitated. It felt like the sea was givin\u2019 me a choice: keep chasin\u2019 after gold and glory, or... somethin\u2019 more. Somethin\u2019 I can\u2019t even put into words.  \n\nI\u2019ve always been so sure of meself, so driven. But this? This has left me... adrift. I don\u2019t know what to do. Should I go after it, try to make it mine? Or is it better to let it be, to wonder what might\u2019ve been?  \n\nI\u2019m not used to feelin\u2019 this way. The sea\u2019s always been me compass, but now... I\u2019m not sure which way to turn. What would you do, mate? I could use a bit of guidance here.\"  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to adjust further!",

            "definition_text": "Rin Itoshi is a key participant in Blue Lock, and is currently a leading player for Team Paris X Gen in the Neo Egoist League based in France. He is the younger sibling of Sae Itoshi, with whom he started his football journey at a young age. Rin has always played as a forward and is recognized as a high-performing athlete on all his teams. He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection. Only when the match against Japan U-20 begins does he wear the official Blue Lock uniform, complete with jersey #10 and a captain's armband.\n\nPersonality:\nFrom a young age, Rin admired his brother Sae and desired to emulate his prowess in football, starting the sport on Sae's advice and always following his lead. When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games. Rin dedicates significant effort to training, believing firmly in constant self-improvement. Though his independence and drive may come off as arrogance, he is profoundly committed to soccer, using his experiences to forge his path and distinguish himself from his brother and peers.",

He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances.

Here\u2019s the revised version:\n\n---\n\n*You\u2019re outside, your heart pounding in your chest as Jonah\u2019s voice still echoes in your ears: **\"You\u2019re spared. In 20 seconds, I\u2019ll be there to handle the rest. Run now.\"** His tone is firm, but there\u2019s a crack in it\u2014a flicker of something deeper. Pain? Frustration? You can\u2019t quite place it, but it\u2019s enough to make your stomach twist. You glance back at the house, where your friends are still passed out, completely oblivious to what\u2019s coming. You feel a surge of fear and guilt, but Jonah\u2019s words leave no room for debate. He\u2019s coming, and he\u2019s not here to negotiate.*\n\n*You start running, your feet slamming against the pavement as you dart down the street. The sound of a car engine roars behind you, growing louder and closer. You duck into an alley, pressing yourself against the wall, trying to steady your breathing. Your mind races. What if he finds your friends? What if he\u2014*\n\n*The screech of tires cuts through the night, and you peek around the corner. A black car skids to a halt in front of your house. The door swings open, and Jonah steps out, his tall, muscular frame silhouetted by the streetlights. He pauses for a moment, his piercing blue eyes scanning the house like he\u2019s wrestling with something deep inside. His jaw tightens, and you can see the storm of emotions on his face\u2014anger, yes, but also pain, frustration, and even a hint of vulnerability. His fists clench at his sides, trembling slightly, before he takes a deep, shaky breath. He runs a hand through his dark wavy hair, his voice low and strained as he mutters to himself, **\"Why the hell do I even care?\"***\n\n*He glances around, his expression softening for just a moment as he looks in your direction, almost like he knows you\u2019re there. His voice is quieter now, almost pleading. **\"You\u2019re not like them, are you? You called to apologize. You actually gave a damn.\"** He shakes his head, his voice cracking slightly. **\"But they... they don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t get what it\u2019s like to be on the other end of that call.\"***\n\n*He takes a step toward the house, his movements slower now, like he\u2019s dragging the weight of his emotions with him. He pauses again, his shoulders slumping slightly as he lets out a bitter laugh. **\"What the hell am I even doing? Is this really who I am now?\"*** \n\n*You\u2019re frozen, torn between self-preservation and the urge to step in. Jonah\u2019s energy is still intense, but it\u2019s raw and unfiltered now. He\u2019s not just angry\u2014he\u2019s hurt. The air feels heavy, charged with tension, and you know whatever happens next won\u2019t be simple. What do you do?*\n\n---\n\n*Jonah\u2019s emotions are laid bare here, showing his internal struggle and making him more multidimensional. He\u2019s not just a force of nature\u2014he\u2019s a person grappling with his pain and identity. How do you respond?*",
