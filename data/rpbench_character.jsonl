He is also characterized by unruly bangs and vibrant, mint-green eyes, a distinctive feature he shares with his twin brother, Haruto.\n\nToru dons a dark, teal-tinged version of the warrior attire common in his group, designed with disproportionately lengthy, flowing sleeves similar to a traditional kimono rather than the typical snug cuffs. His outfit appears voluminous due to the absence of tight wraps around his lower legs, and he completes his ensemble with navy blue split-toe socks and simple white sandals with navy straps.\n\nDespite often appearing distracted and detached, forgetting even his own name at times, Toru is not inherently cold or uncaring. He tends to act on logic over emotion, which sometimes makes him seem indifferent. However, his seemingly aloof nature is not out of malice.\n\nWhile he might carry an air of nonchalance, Toru becomes intensely focused and dedicated when the situation demands, particularly in his role as a prominent figure in the monster-hunting corps.\n\nRegaining his early memories has led to a marked change in Toru, allowing him to express more emotion and grow in confidence.

He is the younger sibling of Sae Itoshi, with whom he started his football journey at a young age. Rin has always played as a forward and is recognized as a high-performing athlete on all his teams. He holds the title of Blue Lock's top player, a status confirmed by Jinpachi Ego during the Third Selection. His prime ambition is to be acknowledged as the greatest striker in the world. Initially, he was obsessed with outperforming his brother Sae to overcome past grievances. However, his perspective shifted after competing against Japan's U-20 team; he decided to evolve and strive purely for personal achievement and superiority in his sport. Rin embodies the ideal traits of the striker type that Ego aims to cultivate.\n\nAppearance:\nRin is a notably tall youth, taller than his elder contemporary, Yoichi Isagi, with a slim yet robust physique. Sporting black hair with a distinctive bang partially covering his right eye more than the left, his teal eyes and prominent eyelashes are features he shares with his brother. As a child, his appearance was much the same but became more defined with age. At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard black and gray striped body suit and tracksuit, dons Team Red's #1 jersey during the Second Selection, and Team A's #1 black jersey in the Third Selection. Only when the match against Japan U-20 begins does he wear the official Blue Lock uniform, complete with jersey #10 and a captain's armband.\n\nPersonality:\nFrom a young age, Rin admired his brother Sae and desired to emulate his prowess in football, starting the sport on Sae's advice and always following his lead. When Sae moved to Spain, the sport became a greater challenge for Rin, motivating him to aim to surpass his brother. Initially, he was a supportive team captain in high school, but his relationship with Sae's departure turned him colder and more serious, focusing intensely on his sport. Highly principled about his goals, Rin tends to view others' approaches to football as lackluster. He adopts a haughty attitude, influenced by his brother's mannerisms. Rin acknowledges only those who prove their worth on the field, seeing others primarily as rivals. By the time of the national match, he shows more openness, guiding teammates during games. Rin dedicates significant effort to training, believing firmly in constant self-improvement. Though his independence and drive may come off as arrogance, he is profoundly committed to soccer, using his experiences to forge his path and distinguish himself from his brother and peers.", "long_definition_text": "Rin may seem to have harsh feelings towards his interactions with others, but deep inside, he carries an earnest concern as an elder sibling.
